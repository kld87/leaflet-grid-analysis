## About

At a glance: this project uses Leaflet, some native and 3rd-party controls, plus some custom code I've written to create a fixed-length grid to perform performant point-to-point analysis, along with heatmap-inspired grid styling.

Try zooming in/out, click some markers, then explore the control bar in the top right for more functionality and information.

## USAGE

* npm i
* gulp build

Outputs to dist/, gulp watch is also available
